# onlinejudge
local judge for programming

This is an online judge, a PC application which lets you login to a server (create an account) and have a
competitive programming experience through difeerent varities of problems with a range of difficulty levels.

It lets you tag different problems with tags you find suitable apart from already available tags which give
a basic hint regarding the approach to solve the problem.

It lets you submit solutions in C and C++, view your previous submissions, view problem statistics, and 
eventually build your competitive profile.

Guidelines:
* Find a .jar file in store folder (onlinejudge.jar)
* Open it. It connects to a server which itself is a project (https://github.com/nishant141077/onjserver). 
  You can otherwise clone both these projects and configure connection settings.
* Register with a new account.
* Login to your account.
* Get started to solve problems.
